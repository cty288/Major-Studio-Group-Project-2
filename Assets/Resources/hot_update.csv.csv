DorchaDaily_1,"Testing… Testing… Oh, we’re on? Ok. Good morning, Dorcha! Since we’re sure to have more than the usual crowd listening today allow me to introduce myself. My name is Donnes, and this is the Dorcha Daily. And while the lockdown may have forced me out of the studio, rest assured the real and reliable news marches on! I know it's been a rough week for us all, and my heart goes out to anyone who has lost a loved one during the initial confusion.",,,,,,
DorchaDaily_2,"Annnndd welcome back to Dorcha Daily, where our mission to deliver the real and reliable news straight to you. Well I guess it’s official now, folks: this lockdown is here to stay. I know that after two straight weeks of this some people are starting to get a little antsy. But I cannot stress enough, STAY INSIDE. It’s not worth the risk… These couriers are volunteers from some of Dorcha’s best and brightest veterans and officers, and from the reports most of them don’t seem make it back. I know we’ve all heard the endless reports of the dead and the missing. Just sit tight, listen to the radio, and appreciate the fact that our phones are back up. There are plenty of helpful folks out there, just waiting on the other side of the line. Well, I think that’s all for today. This has been Donnes of the Dorcha Daily, giving you the whole truth, uncomfortable though it may be. This night’s not over yet, just buckle up and bunker in. We can make it.",,,,,,
DorchaDaily_3,"Annnndd welcome back to the Dorcha Daily, where our mission is delivering real and reliable news straight to you. As we enter the third week of lockdown, tensions have been running understandably high, and that whole power outage sure didn’t help. Hopefully you loyal listeners heeded my earlier warnings and were prepared in advance. Now the Mayor has hopped on the airwaves a little while ago to give us a bit of a pep talk, but a confidential source tells me that things are looking far lower than he’s eager to let on. That “complete and continuous support” other countries promised? Yeah, looks like we should have read the fine print on that one. I wouldn’t be surprised if supplies start to run dry in the weeks to come, and once that happens I suspect the couriers won’t be quite so generous with their servings. And on that depressing note, it looks like we’re out of time. This has been Donnes of the Dorcha Daily, giving you everything that they won’t tell you. Hold on to those rations like your life depends on them… because they might very well.",,,,,,
