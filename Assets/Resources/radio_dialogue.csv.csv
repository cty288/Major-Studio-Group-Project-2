GhostStories_1,ContentText,"Welcome back to GTS, your home for the unnatural and almost unbelievable. We know things are a little scary out in the world right now, but that’s no excuse to turn a blind eye. To stay safe, you must stay in the know! Today we have a local caller who claims this lockdown isn’t the first time she’s run into the supernatural… Caller?","Hey Krane, long time listener, first time caller. And it's just like you said, the supernatural has been around for ages now, people were just too blind to see it! My neighbor’s dog has been possessed by a demon for at least three years now!","Really now, what makes you say that?","Well the little hellspawn hates everything it sees, and it must have realized I saw through its feeble disguise because the first time it saw me it nearly tore my face off. Now it can’t even seem to stand my neighbor, it’s been yapping at her ever since she got her last delivery. ","Wow! You heard it here first folks! Your Mister Snuggles may in fact be Satan reborn! Truly danger lies where you least expect it. Well that seems like all the time we have for today, be sure to tune in next time for another story that will befuddle and bewilder!",,

GhostStories_2,ContentText,"Gather around, dear listeners, for I have a tale to tell that will send shivers down your spine. The night is dark and full of terrors, and things are definitely getting stranger by the minute in our town. I believe we’ve all witnessed some sort of animal craziness this past week ain’t I right?
Ominous flock of birds... Barking dogs...you name it, we’ve seen it. But that's not the scariest part! One of our callers claims to have seen a possessed cat running around town. Let’s dive in deeper with our caller here, Brian!
","Hello? Oh dear radio hosts. I have a story that defies explanation, but I promise it's true! Just the other night, I heard a faint knock on my door. At first I thought it was a starving cat. However, its fur is a shade of black that seems to absorb light, and its eyes emit a strange, hypnotic glow that leaves you feeling disoriented.","What a strange visitor to have in the middle of the night! Tell us more!","Well….I tried to move right up to her and that’s when I saw it. The Cat. It had three glowing red eyes!  I swear, I could feel its eyes burning into my soul! Before I could do anything, the creature vanished into thin air. I don't know if it was a ghost or a demon, but I don't want to find out. You see, even now I can hear the echoing of its calls in my dreams.","Oh my! What a terrifying story! But it's truly a story we wanna hear more on this channel! They say curiosity killed the cat, but in this case, it might just lead you to the ghostly truth itself! So, listeners, stay safe. Keep your doors locked and your eyes peeled. We're all in this together, and we need to be vigilant if we want to survive. Stay tuned to our next story another time!

GhostStories_3,ContentText,"Our forefathers were not the first to inhabit these lands, when they first stepped upon these shores they soon realized they were not alone. These were the Fair Folk, transcendent spirits of nature born from the very breath of the Earth. They had dwelled on these lands since the planet’s first primordial cry of life, watching the world unfold with keen eyes and curious minds. ","When those wretched naked apes washed ashore, the Fair Folk treated them with grace. They saw all life as kindred, bound intrinsically by the will of the Earth. Yet when faced with the realization they were not alone, Man, in their boundless lust for dominance, saw not partners but rivals.","The Fair Folk were not savvy in the way of warcraft as men were. Perhaps they had the strength to defend themselves, but they had no concept of malice. Man would slaughter their young, extort the earth, and ravage their homes. If they could not win, they would burn the world to ensure no other could. By the cold wrought iron of Man the Fair Folk were hunted, butchered by ax and blade alike. ","On the brink of annihilation the Fair Folk had no choice but to yield the lands, retreating to the Otherworld in hopes of evading Man’s wrath. There they hid, watching from a distance as their home was torn apart, watching as the world cried out in pain. There they learned from Man, how to imitate their cruelty, how to master their malice. There they waited, for the time of the darkest day, for the time they could reclaim what was theirs. ","this. is. not. your. home. it. never. was.

GhostStories_4,ContentText,"Hello listeners and welcome back to GTS. First things first, I’d have to apologize for last week's segment. Krane called in last week and said he would be able to handle the show by himself, only to go completely off the rails. Needless to say we haven’t been able to get in contact with him since… nevertheless the show goes on and I want you to rest assured that today we return to our regularly scheduled program. Today we have a caller who claims to have unraveled the mystery behind a series of cases in our town.","Thanks for having me on, I have to warn you that this story may strike some close to home. Yet, if you're willing to reject the convenient truth and dig a little deeper, stay tuned. Some of you may remember the events that shocked Dorcha nearly a decade ago. When a string of disappearances was revealed to in fact be a series of violent murders. However these weren’t the case of imposters, but of a single demented mind.","Police spent months attempting to deduce who was at the center of these killings, and eventually they were able to emerge with a suspect. However, try as they might, they were unable to definitively tie him to any of the murders. Until, right before they gave up, a single photo book was found beneath the suspect’s floorboards. In this book, was the evidence that blew the case wide open.","You see, this photo book wasn’t a normal album of nature shots or family events. It was a carefully curated collection of each of the victims, each photo taken over months of stalking and without the victims knowledge. All culminating in a final photo of them moments before their life faded from their eyes.","With this smoking gun, the police locked away the suspect and threw away the key… or that’s what they would like you to believe. Because I ask you dear listener… just who do you know in our town with an expertise in killing and a fixation on photographs? And isn’t it just a little bit strange that such a prolific bounty hunter was living in Dorcha of all places?","Or maybe, in our darkest hour we turned to a devil to save us?","Oh my… umm… ok… That’s a pretty hefty accusation you’re putting out there, but I suppose it’s up to our listeners to choose what to believe. That’s all we have for today, but make sure to stay safe out there listeners. Keep your doors locked and your eyes peeled, and we’ll have another story for you next time!"
